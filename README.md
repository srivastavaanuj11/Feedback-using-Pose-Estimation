# Feedback-using-Pose-Estimation
# Product plan
Objective - To alert the person if he does wrong body movements in realtime while he is doing the excercise.

Implementation- Here I would use pose estimation algorithm for getting realtime information about the body movements. Then I will check whether the values from information gathered are in the acceptable range for that particular excercise or not. If not he would get a realtime feedback from the system. The feedback system would be designed using Fuzzy Logic. It would also keep track of all the excercises the user has performed for the day and also saves a seperate excercise schedule for each user.

Applications - Usually, in normal gyms the number of gym trainers are less as compared to the people who come for workout. Therefore it becomes very difficult for gym trainers to manage so many people. So, by this method we can keep track of many users at a single time, therefore increasing the efficiency of the gym. If you are doing any wrong bodymovement , the gym trainer may sometimes forget to tell you but here its not the case. Another advantage is that people inside their homes, it would be like having your gym trainer in your own home.
